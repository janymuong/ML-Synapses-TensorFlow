# ML Synapses - AI/ML in `TensorFlow`

My notes, code, and resources from [`DeepLearning.AI`](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)

> Machine Learning and Neural Networks using `TensorFlow`.  

## Scope:
- Learn `TensorFlow`, an open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for computer vision problem sets.

- Handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.

- Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.

- Applying RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs and train them using text repositories.

In a nutshell, this is all meant to `build`, `train`, and `optimize` **deep neural networks** and to improve model performance with advanced techniques. Specific areas covered include Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Time Series Analysis.
